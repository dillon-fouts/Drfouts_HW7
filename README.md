Project Description
This project develops a web-based survey tailored for Business Analytics students, aimed at gathering insights into their academic experiences and demographic information. Implemented through a multi-page form, this survey facilitates a user-friendly and engaging way for students to share feedback.

Best Practices for Forms
Our web form has been meticulously designed to adhere to industry best practices, ensuring a seamless and efficient user experience. Key considerations include:

Clarity and Simplicity: Each question is concisely phrased, avoiding any ambiguity. We've structured the form to logically flow from one question to the next, which helps in maintaining the respondent's focus and prevents any potential confusion.

Consistent Layout: The form maintains a consistent layout throughout, with a clear distinction between different sections. This consistency aids in reducing the cognitive load on users, making the form more intuitive.

Field Validations and Mandatory Fields: Essential fields are marked and validated on the client side before submission. This proactive approach minimizes errors and ensures that users provide all necessary information, improving the quality of data collected.

Grouping Related Information: Related questions are grouped together under clear headings. This not only organizes the form better but also helps users mentally categorize the information they provide, enhancing the overall completion rate.

Providing Assistance: For questions that may require additional context, tooltips are implemented. These are accessible on hover or focus, offering immediate assistance without cluttering the form with excessive information.

Accessibility Considerations
Accessibility has been a cornerstone in the design and implementation of our web form. We've taken specific steps to ensure that our forms are accessible to all users, including those with disabilities:

Semantic HTML: Use of semantic elements and ARIA (Accessible Rich Internet Applications) labels ensures that the form is comprehensible for users with assistive technologies such as screen readers.

Keyboard Navigation: The form is fully navigable using a keyboard, catering to users who cannot use a mouse. This includes accessible tab orders and focus indicators.

Contrast and Font Sizes: Adhering to WCAG guidelines, we've ensured high contrast ratios and adjustable font sizes, making the form easier to read for users with visual impairments.

Responsive Design: The form is responsive, ensuring that it is accessible on devices of varying sizes, from mobile phones to desktops, accommodating users with different preferences and accessibilities.

By integrating these practices, our form not only complies with accessibility standards but also provides a more inclusive environment, allowing every student to participate without barriers.
